# WIN_LOCK :unlock:
WIN_LOCK is an application that simulates the Windows 10 lock-screen in which the current user enters his/her PIN. This PIN is then shown in a pop. It is written in C#.

### HOW TO USE IT :white_check_mark:
- Compile this via VISUAL STUDIO
- Run the EXE generated
- Wait for fake lock-screen to pop up
- DONE
  
### HOW TO NOT USE IT :x:
- WIN_LOCKER is not meant to be used as a PIN stealer
- It doesn't send any information to anyone via any means

### Working :wrench:
- First attempt to enter pin is denied
- The PIN entered at second attempt is shown
- After Clicking or executing the application lock-screen is shown after a pause
- To exit in between use ESC
